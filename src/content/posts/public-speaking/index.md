Public speaking? More like public freaking out for me. Public speaking isn't exactly on anyone's favorite activities list. But for some of us, the mere thought of standing in front of an audience triggers a full-blown panic attack. I'm one of those "some of us." `Glossophobia`, the fear of public speaking, has been my unwelcome companion for as long as I can remember.

It all starts so sneakily. My mind goes totally blank, like someone flicked a switch. Then the self-doubt kicks in: "What if I forget everything?" "What if they laugh?" "What if I pass out?" Next thing I know, fear takes over, turning into this monster that gobbles up all my confidence and threatens to swallow me whole.

I'm not terrible at talking. I can chat like a normal person. But stick me in front of a crowd, and I become a stumbling, bumbling mess. It's like my brain decides to take a vacation, leaving me with just a racing heart and a desperate wish to vanish.

This fear has messed up so many things for me. I've missed out on opportunities, given presentations on autopilot, and dodged more social events than I can count. It's annoying, lonely, and honestly, pretty darn embarrassing. But you know what? I'm sick of letting it call the shots.
